# Digital DNA
**Prerequisite:** An elementary understanding of Digital Logic
**Objective:** Mastering Verilog Through Creative Circuit Design
**Task:** Begin your journey into Verilog HDL by building meaningful projects.
## What is Verilog?
Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to design and model digital electronic systems such as microprocessors, FPGAs, and ASICs..
**Purpose:** Instead of drawing circuits with gates and wires, you describe hardware behavior in code.
**Usage:** Widely used in VLSI design, FPGA programming, and ASIC development.
**Nature:** Unlike software languages (C, Python), Verilog doesn’t write instructions for a CPU—it describes actual hardware circuits.
### Types of modelling in Verilog 
1. Structural Modelling: Describe how gates/wires are connected.
2. Behavioral Modelling Describe circuit behavior using always blocks, if, case, etc.
3. Dataflow Modelling: Use Boolean expressions.
**Task 1**Design and test an 8-bit signed arithmetic unit with operations:
Addition (00),Subtraction (01),Comparison (10) & Absolute difference (11)
Generate 3 status flags: overflow, zero, negative
**Outcomes and Process**
- Using of case statemes for each operation.
